This is an extension of Fady Youssef's free Mac OSX icon pack, ficons. .png files are icons I added and .icns files are the original icons in the pack. 
If you have any requests for icons, email me and I will implement them. 


Instructions for replacing icons: 
-Download LiteIcon here: https://freemacsoft.net/liteicon/
-Replace icons using search bar or by category. 

*If LiteIcon says to disable System Integrity Protection, go here and follow intructions:
